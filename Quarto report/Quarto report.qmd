This project aims at disentangling the relative contribution of soil physico-chemistry and fungal communities in driving *Lonicera maackii* performance. In 2019, we sampled 50 soil inocula, from 5 distinct sites, and grew *Lonicera maackii* in these inocula in a growth chamber, for 12 weeks.

We measured shoot dry mass, root length and average diameter, and root fungal colonization as response variables.

In parallel, for each inoculum, we measured soil physico-chemistry and extracted DNA from \~250mg soil to characterize fungal community structure using Illumina MiSeq technology (PE250bp), with amplicons targeting the ITS2 region ([primers = gITS7 \[fwd\] and ITS4 \[rev\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3369-3_4)). Data are provided as follows:

1.  Soil properties, fungal root colonization and *Lonicera* performance are all included in the file [lonicera.txt](../DATA/lonicera.txt). *Lonicera* growth data is averaged for pseudo-replicates belonging to the same inoculum, but raw data for all pseudo-replicates separately are available in [raw.growth.txt](../DATA/raw.growth.txt).

2.  Soil fungal community structure can be found in the file [comm.txt](../DATA/comm.txt), where row names are inocula ID and number within each cell are the number of reads found in each inoculum for the corresponding column (fungal sequence variant). The 7-levels taxonomy, under the form of a table with rows corresponding to columns in [`comm.txt`](../DATA/comm.txt) is provided in the [`taxa.txt`](../DATA/taxa.txt). We also provide raw sequence files within the sequence read archives (SRA) under the [`BioProject # PRJNA1049398`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1049398). The SRR numbers associated with all samples can be found in our file [SRRs.txt](../DATA/SRRs.txt)

(1990)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00476.x), we estimated the frequency of root colonization by *Arum*-type arbuscules, after staining in ink-vineagar (5% v/v)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| ves          | Vesicles colonization frequency (%)                      | Again with the gridline intersect method, colonization frequency of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vesicles was estimated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| nonmyc       | Non-mycorrhizal structure colonizaiton frequency (%)     | Any fungal (or Oomycota) structure that could be clearly established to be non-AM fungal, or not belonging to a dark septate endophyte (see below), was recorded in this category. This includes regularly septate hyphae but not thick melanized hyphae appearing as DSE, and structures looking like *Olpidium* chlamydospores, or oomycete oospores...                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| dse          | Dark septate endophytes root colonization frequency (%)  | In this category were included fungal structure with relatively large hyphal diameter, regular septation, melanized brown appearance and a clear diagnostic feature was the presence of either linear chains, or tufts of microsclerotia. Recognizing that some dark septate endophytes can also stain heavily with ink (and not appear as brownish melanized hyphae), our estimate is not intended to be a clear guild-level colonization estimate, but rather a morphology/appearance-based estimation of different categories of non-AM fungal structures, along with "nonmyc". |

# Bioinformatics

All raw `.fastq` sequence files are available in the sequence read archives. To retrieve the files, simply use `prefetch` and `fasterq-dump` from the `sra toolkit`. More information available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sradownload/). In our case, all SRRs required for download are grouped in the file [SRRs.txt](../DATA/SRRs.txt):

``` {sh}
#| code-fold: false
### Assuming we are in the main (Parent) directory of the project
prefetch --option-file ./DATA/SRRs.txt -O Reads/
mkdir fastq_files
cd fastq_files
for i in ../Reads/*/*.sra ; do fasterq-dump $i; done
cd ..
```

After that, the `Reads` folder can simply be removed, as all the fastqfiles are now in the current directory and ready for downstream `dada2` analyses.

``` {sh}
#| code-fold: false
rm -r Reads
```

We are then ready to move on with bioinformatic treatment of these sequences, once we have them in the directory named `fastq_files`. This is done using the R script [dada2_bioinfo_script.R](../SCRIPTS/dada2_bioinfo_script.R). What this does:

``` {r}

library(dada2)
path <- "./fastq_files"
list.files(path)
thr=20

fnFs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_1.fastq", full.names = TRUE))
fnRs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_2.fastq", full.names = TRUE))

sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs), "_"), `[`, 1)

filtFs <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_F_filt.fastq.gz"))
filtRs <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_R_filt.fastq.gz"))
names(filtFs) <- sample.names
names(filtRs) <- sample.names

out <- filterAndTrim(fnFs, filtFs, fnRs, filtRs, 
        truncLen=c(250,200),
        trimLeft=c(19,20),
        maxN=0, 
        truncQ=2, 
        compress=TRUE, multithread=thr) 

errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread=thr)
errR <- learnErrors(filtRs, multithread=thr)


dadaFs <- dada(filtFs, err=errF, multithread=thr)
dadaRs <- dada(filtRs, err=errR, multithread=thr)

mergers <- mergePairs(dadaFs, filtFs, dadaRs, filtRs, verbose=TRUE)

seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(mergers)

seqtab.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, method="consensus", multithread=thr, verbose=TRUE)

getN <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x))
track <- cbind(out, sapply(dadaFs, getN), sapply(dadaRs, getN), sapply(mergers, getN), rowSums(seqtab.nochim))
colnames(track) <- c("input", "filtered", "denoisedF", "denoisedR", "merged", "nonchim")
rownames(track) <- sample.names
head(track)
write.table(track,"track.txt",row.names=F,col.names=F,sep="\t")

taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, "UNITE_9.0_2023-07-25.fasta", multithread=20)

save.image("OutputITS.RData")
```

...

# Dataset filtering

The object `OutputITS.RData` contains a ASVs $\times$ samples table, with non-chimeric fungal sequences as columns and all study samples (and additional rows from another study also included in the MiSeq run in fact!) as rows. Unfortunately, sequencing depth was quite uneven among samples.

As a first filtering, we keep only the 50 samples relevant for our current *Lonicera* study:

``` {r}
rm(list=ls())
load("OutputITS.RData")

### keep only the non-chimeric sequence table and the associated taxonomy for columns (fungal ASVs)
rm(list=setdiff(ls(),c("seqtab.nochim","taxa")))    

### filter
x=seqtab.nochim
y=x[sapply(strsplit(rownames(x),"-"),'[',1)%in%1:50,]   

### Store the community table (ASV x samples) in the object "comm" and clean up the environment
comm=y
rm(list=setdiff(ls(),c("comm","taxa"))) 

### save the environment
save.image("Lonicera_ITS.RData")
```

Then, because several samples came out either with no reads, or very few (see below), we needed to filter out these samples:

``` {r}
rm(list=ls())
load("Lonicera_ITS.RData")
library(showtext)
library(Hmisc)
showtext_auto()
par(family="raleway")
png("../figures/sequencing_depth.png",res=1200,units="in",height=3.5,width=3.5)
par(mar=c(4,3,1,1))
rownames(comm)=paste0("Inoc. ",sapply(strsplit(rownames(comm),"-"),'[',1))
x=barplot(rowSums(comm)[order(rowSums(comm))],width=.5,space=.5,horiz=T,yaxt="n",xaxt="n",xlim=c(0,80000),yaxs="i",col="#2E4B7F",border=NA,cex.axis=1,ylim=c(0,38))
rect(-10,-10,100000,100,col="grey96",border=NA)
abline(v=seq(0,100000,10000),lwd=.5,lty=3,col="grey80")
x=barplot(rowSums(comm)[order(rowSums(comm))],width=.5,space=.5,horiz=T,yaxt="n",xaxt="n",xlim=c(0,80000),yaxs="i",col="#2E4B7F",border=NA, add=T)
tt=rownames(comm)[order(rowSums(comm))]
axis(1,mgp=c(1.5,.02,0),cex.axis=7,lwd=.8,tck=.04)
minor.tick(nx=4,ny=1,tick.ratio=-.5)
text(x=1000,y=x,tt,pos=2,xpd=T,cex=4)
title(xlab="Sequences reads",mgp=c(1.5,.1,0),cex.lab=12)
box(lwd=.8)
dev.off()
```

<br>

Now (1) filtering samples with sufficient sequence reads, (2) rarefying at a fixed sequencing effort per sample and (3) removing fungal ASVs (columns):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false 
rm(list=ls())
load("Lonicera_ITS.RData")
comm=comm[rowSums(comm)>5000,]
library(vegan)
comm=rrarefy(comm,32912)
temp=comm[,!colSums(comm)==0]
taxa=taxa[!colSums(comm)==0,]
comm=temp
save.image("Lonicera_ITS_rarefied.RData")
```
